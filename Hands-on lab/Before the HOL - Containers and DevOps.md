# Containers and DevOps before the hands-on lab setup guide

## Requirements

1. Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN.

    - Trial subscriptions will *not* work.

    - You must have rights to create a service principal as discussed in Task 9: Create a Service Principal --- and this typically requires a subscription owner to log in. You may have to ask another subscription owner to login to the portal and execute that step ahead of time if you do not have the rights.

    - You must have enough cores available in your subscription to create the build agent and Azure Kubernetes Service cluster in Task 5: Create a build agent VM and Task 10: Create an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster. You'll need eight cores if following the exact instructions in the lab, more if you choose additional agents or larger VM sizes. If you execute the steps required before the lab, you will be able to see if you need to request more cores in your sub.

2. An Azure DevOps account

3. Local machine or a virtual machine configured with:

    - A browser, preferably Chrome for consistency with the lab implementation tests.

    - Command prompt.

         - On Windows, you will be using Bash on Ubuntu on Windows, hereon referred to as WSL.

         - On Mac, all instructions should be executed using bash in Terminal.

4. You will be asked to install other tools throughout the exercises.

## Before the hands-on lab

**Duration**: 1 hour

You should follow all of the steps provided in this section *before* taking part in the hands-on lab ahead of time as some of these steps take time.

### Task 1: Resource Group

You will create an Azure Resource Group to hold most of the resources that you create in this hands-on lab. This approach will make it easier to clean up later. You will be instructed to create new resources in this Resource Group during the remaining exercises.

1. In your browser, navigate to the **Azure Portal** (<https://portal.azure.com>).

2. Select **+ Create a resource** in the navigation bar at the left.

    ![This is a screenshot of the + Create a resource link in the navigation bar.](media/b4-image4.png)

3. In the Search the Marketplace search box, type \"Resource group\" and press Enter.

    ![Resource Group is typed in the Marketplace search box.](media/b4-image5.png)

4. Select **Resource group** on the Everything blade and select **Create**.

    ![This is a screenshot of Resource group on the Everything blade.](media/b4-image6.png)

5. On the new Resource group blade, set the following:

    - **Subscription:** Select the subscription you will use for all the steps during the lab.

    - **Resource group:** Enter something like "fabmedical-SUFFIX", as shown in the following screenshot.

    - **Region:** Choose a region where all Azure Container Registry SKUs are available, which is currently Canada Central, Canada East, North Central US, Central US, South Central US, East US, East US 2, West US, West US 2, West Central US, France Central, UK South, UK West, North Europe, West Europe, Australia East, Australia Southeast, Brazil South, Central India, South India, Japan East, Japan West, Korea Central, Southeast Asia, East Asia, and remember this for future steps so that the resources you create in Azure are all kept within the same region.

    ![In the Resource group blade, the value for the Resource group box is fabmedical-sol, and the value of the Region box is East US.](media/b4-image7.png)

    - Select **Review + Create** and then **Create**.

6. When this completes, your Resource Group will be listed in the Azure Portal.

    ![In this screenshot of the Azure Portal, the fabmedical-sol Resource group is listed.](media/b4-image8.png)

### Task 2: Create an SSH key

In this section, you will create an SSH key to securely access the VMs you create during the upcoming exercises.

1. Open cloud shell by selecting the cloud shell icon in the menu bar.

    ![The cloud shell icon is highlighted on the menu bar.](media/b4-image35.png)

2. The cloud shell will open in the browser window. Choose "Bash" if prompted or use the left-hand dropdown on the shell menu bar to choose "Bash" (as shown).

    ![This is a screenshot of the cloud shell opened in a browser window. Bash was selected.](media/b4-image36.png)

3. Before completing the steps to create the SSH key, you should make sure to set your default subscription correctly. To view your current subscription type:

    ``` bash
    az account show
    ```

    ![In this screenshot of a Bash window, az account show has been typed and run at the command prompt. Some subscription information is visible in the window, and some information is obscured.](media/b4-image37.png)

4. To list all of your subscriptions, type:

    ``` bash
    az account list
    ```

    ![In this screenshot of a Bash window, az account list has been typed and run at the command prompt. Some subscription information is visible in the window, and some information is obscured.](media/b4-image38.png)

5. To set your default subscription to something other than the current selection, type the following, replacing {id} with the desired subscription id value:

    ``` bash
    az account set --subscription {id}
    ```

6. From the cloud shell command line, enter the following command to ensure that a directory for the SSH keys is created. You can ignore any errors you see in the output.

    ``` bash
        mkdir .ssh
    ```

7. From the cloud shell command line, enter the following command to generate an SSH key pair. You can replace "admin" with your preferred name or handle.

    ``` bash
    ssh-keygen -t RSA -b 2048 -C admin@fabmedical
    ```

8. You will be asked to save the generated key to a file. Enter \".ssh/fabmedical\" for the name.

9. Enter a passphrase when prompted, and **don't forget it**!

10. Because you entered ".ssh/fabmedical", the file will be generated in the ".ssh" folder in your user folder, where cloud shell opens by default.

11. Keep this cloud shell open and remain in the default directory, you will use it in later tasks.

    ![In this screenshot of the cloud shell window, ssh-keygen -t RSA -b 2048 -C admin\@fabmedical has been typed and run at the command prompt. Information about the generated key appears in the window.](media/b4-image57.png)

12. Type the following command at the cloud shell prompt to display the public key that you generated and save the entire content of the file because you will need it later:

    ``` bash
    cat .ssh/fabmedical.pub
    ```

    ![In this screenshot of the cloud shell window, cat .ssh/fabmedical.pub has been typed and run at the command prompt, which displays the public key that you generated.](media/b4-image59.png)

### Task 3: Create a Service Principal

Azure Kubernetes Service requires an Azure Active Directory service principal to interact with Azure APIs. The service principal is needed to dynamically manage resources such as user-defined routes and the Layer 4 Azure Load Balancer. The easiest way to set up the service principal is using the Azure cloud shell.

> **Note**: By default, creating a service principal in Azure AD requires account owner permission. You may have trouble creating a service principal if you are not the account owner.

1. Open cloud shell by selecting the cloud shell icon in the menu bar.

    ![The cloud shell icon is highlighted on the menu bar.](media/b4-image35.png)

2. The cloud shell will open in the browser window. Choose "Bash" if prompted or use the left-hand dropdown on the shell menu bar to choose "Bash" (as shown).

    ![This is a screenshot of the cloud shell opened in a browser window. Bash was selected.](media/b4-image36.png)

3. Before completing the steps to create the service principal, you should make sure to set your default subscription correctly. To view your current subscription type:

    ``` bash
    az account show
    ```

    ![In this screenshot of a Bash window, az account show has been typed and run at the command prompt. Some subscription information is visible in the window, and some information is obscured.](media/b4-image37.png)

4. To list all of your subscriptions, type:

    ``` bash
    az account list
    ```

    ![In this screenshot of a Bash window, az account list has been typed and run at the command prompt. Some subscription information is visible in the window, and some information is obscured.](media/b4-image38.png)

5. To set your default subscription to something other than the current selection, type the following, replacing {id} with the desired subscription id value:

    ``` bash
    az account set --subscription {id}
    ```

6. To create a service principal, type the following command, replacing {id} with your subscription identifier, and replacing suffix with your chosen suffix to make the name unique:

    ``` bash
    az ad sp create-for-rbac --role="Contributor" --scopes="/subscriptions/{id}" --name="http://Fabmedical-sp-{SUFFIX}"
    ```

7. The service principal command will produce output like this. Copy this information; you will need it later.

    ![In this screenshot of a Bash window, az ad sp create-for-rbac \--role=\"Contributor\" \--scopes=\"/subscriptions/{id}\" \--name=\"Fabmedical-sp-SUFFIX\" has been typed and run at the command prompt. Service principal information is visible in the window, but at this time, we are unable to capture all of the information in the window. Future versions of this course should address this.](media/b4-image39.png)

8. To get the service principal object id, type the following command, replacing {appId} with your service principal appId:

    ``` bash
    az ad sp show --id {appId} --query "{objectId:@.objectId}"
    ```

9. The service principal information command will produce output like this. Copy this information; you will need it later.

    ![In this screenshot of a Bash window, az ad sp show --id d41261a3-d8b8-4cf0-890d-1fb6efc20a67 --query \"{objectId:@.objectId}\" has been typed and run at the command prompt. Service Principal information is visible in the window.](media/b4-image58.png)

### Task 4: ARM Template

In this section, you will configure and execute an ARM template that will create all the resources that you will need throughout the exercises.

1. Open cloud shell by selecting the cloud shell icon in the menu bar.

    ![The cloud shell icon is highlighted on the menu bar.](media/b4-image35.png)

2. The cloud shell will open in the browser window. Choose "Bash" if prompted or use the left-hand dropdown on the shell menu bar to choose "Bash" (as shown).

    ![This is a screenshot of the cloud shell opened in a browser window. Bash was selected.](media/b4-image36.png)

3. Before completing the steps to create the service principal, you should make sure to set your default subscription correctly. To view your current subscription type:

    ``` bash
    az account show
    ```

    ![In this screenshot of a Bash window, az account show has been typed and run at the command prompt. Some subscription information is visible in the window, and some information is obscured.](media/b4-image37.png)

4. To list all of your subscriptions, type:

    ``` bash
    az account list
    ```

    ![In this screenshot of a Bash window, az account list has been typed and run at the command prompt. Some subscription information is visible in the window, and some information is obscured.](media/b4-image38.png)

5. To set your default subscription to something other than the current selection, type the following, replacing {id} with the desired subscription id value:

    ``` bash
    az account set --subscription {id}
    ```

6. Download the parameters starter file by typing the following curl instruction (case sensitive):

    ```bash
    curl -L -o azuredeploy.parameters.json https://bit.ly/2XHyVaY
    ```

7. Open the azuredeploy.parameters.json file for editing using Vim, and press the "i" key to go into edit mode.

    ```bash
    vi azuredeploy.parameters.json
    <i>
    ```

8. Update the values for the various keys so that they match your environment:

    - **Suffix**: Enter something like "SUF" with max of 3 chars.
    - **VirtualMachineAdminUsername**: The Windows 10 Development VM admin username (example: `"adminfabmedical"`).
    - **VirtualMachineAdminPassword**: The Windows 10 Development VM admin password (example: `"Password$123"`).
    - **VirtualMachineAdminUsernameLinux**: The Linux Build Agent VM admin username (example: `"adminfabmedical"`).
    - **VirtualMachineAdminPublicKeyLinux**: The Linux Build Agent VM admin ssh public key. Use the information from a previous step (example: `"ssh-rsa AAAAB3N(...)vPiybQV admin@fabmedical"`).
    - **KubernetesServicePrincipalClientId**: The Kubernetes Cluster Service Principal Client Id. Use the service principal âappIdâ from a previous step.
    - **KubernetesServicePrincipalClientSecret**: The Kubernetes Cluster Service Principal Client Secret. Use the service principal âpasswordâ from a previous step.
    - **KubernetesServicePrincipalObjectId**: The Kubernetes Cluster Service Principal Object Id. Use the service principal âobjectIdâ from a previous step.

9. Press the Escape key and type ":wq". Then press the Enter key to save and close the file.

    ```text
    <Esc>
    :wq
    <Enter>
    ```

10. Create the needed resources by typing the following instruction (case sensitive), replacing {resourceGroup} with the name of the previously created resource group:

    ```bash
    az group deployment create --resource-group {resourceGroup} --template-uri https://bit.ly/2XCaXh2 --parameters azuredeploy.parameters.json
    ```

### Task 5: Connect to the Windows 10 Development VM

> **Note**: Setting up the development machine is optional for Mac OS since you will use Terminal for commands. Setting up the development machine is also optional if you are certain you have a working installation of WSL on your current Windows 10 VM.

In this section, you will connect to the created Windows 10 VM to act as your development machine. You will install the required components to complete the lab using this machine. You will use this machine instead of your local machine to carry out the instructions during the lab.

1. From the Azure Portal, you will see the VM in your list of resources belonging to the resource group you created previously and select the new VM.

    ![This screenshot of your resource list has the following columns: Name, Type, and Location. The first row is highlighted with the following values: fabmedicald-(suffix obscured), Virtual machine, and West Europe.](media/b4-image14.png)

2. In the Overview area for the VM, select Connect to establish a Remote Desktop Connection (RDP) for the VM.

    ![In this screenshot of the Overview area for the VM, a red arrow points at the Connect icon.](media/b4-image15.png)

3. Complete the steps to establish the RDP session and ensure that you are connected to the new VM.

### Task 6: Install WSL (Bash on Ubuntu on Windows)

>**Note**: If you are using a Windows 10 development machine, follow these steps. For Mac OS you can ignore this step since you will be using Terminal for all commands.

You will need WSL to complete various steps. A complete list of instructions for supported Windows 10 versions is available on this page:

<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10>

### Task 7: Connect securely to the build agent

In this section, you will validate that you can connect to the new build agent VM.

1. From the Azure portal, navigate to the Resource Group you created previously and select the new VM, fabmedical-SUFFIX.

2. In the Overview area for the VM, take note of the public IP address for the VM.

    ![In this screenshot of the Overview area for the VM, Public IP address 52.174.141.11 is highlighted.](media/b4-image26.png)

3. In the cloud shell window, type the following command and copy the output:

    ```bash
    cat .ssh/fabmedical
    ```

    ![In this screenshot of the cloud shell window, cat .ssh/fabmedical has been typed and run at the command prompt, which displays the private key that you generated.](media/b4-image60.png)

4. From your development machine, return to your open WSL window and make sure you are in your user directory **\~** where you will save the SSH key pair that was previously created. This command will take you there:

    ``` bash
    cd ~
    ```

5. Create the .ssh directory and the fabmedical file for editing using Vim, and press the "i" key to go into edit mode.

    ```bash
    mkdir .ssh
    vi .ssh/fabmedical
    <i>
    ```

6. Paste the private key information that you copied earlier.

7. Press the Escape key and type ":wq". Then press the Enter key to save and close the file.

    ```text
    <Esc>
    :wq
    <Enter>
    ```
8. Update the permission for the fabmedical file.

    ```text
     sudo chmod 600 ~/.ssh/fabmedical
     ```

9. Connect to the new VM you created by typing the following command:

    ``` bash
     ssh -i [PRIVATEKEYNAME] [BUILDAGENTUSERNAME]@[BUILDAGENTIP]
    ```

    Replace the bracketed values in the command as follows:

    - [PRIVATEKEYNAME]: Use the private key name ".ssh/fabmedical," created above.

    - [BUILDAGENTUSERNAME]: Use the username for the VM, such as adminfabmedical.

    - [BUILDAGENTIP]: The IP address for the build agent VM, retrieved from the VM Overview blade in the Azure Portal.

    ``` bash
    ssh -i .ssh/fabmedical adminfabmedical@52.174.141.11
    ```

10. When asked to confirm if you want to connect, as the authenticity of the connection cannot be validated, type "yes".

11. When asked for the passphrase for the private key you created previously, enter this value.

12. You will connect to the VM with a command prompt such as the following. Keep this command prompt open for the next step:

    `adminfabmedical@fabmedical-SUFFIX:~$`

    ![In this screenshot of a Command Prompt window, ssh -i .ssh/fabmedical adminfabmedical\@52.174.141.11 has been typed and run at the command prompt. The information detailed above appears in the window. At this time, we are unable to capture all of the information in the window. Future versions of this course should address this.](media/b4-image27.png)

>**Note**: If you have issues connecting, you may have pasted the SSH public key incorrectly in the ARM template. Unfortunately, if this is the case, you will have to recreate the VM and try again.

### Task 8: Complete the build agent setup

In this task, you will update the packages and install Docker engine.

1. Go to the WSL window that has the SSH connection open to the build agent VM.

2. Update the Ubuntu packages and install curl and support for repositories over HTTPS in a single step by typing the following in a single line command. When asked if you would like to proceed, respond by typing "Y" and pressing enter.

    ``` bash
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
    ```

3. Add Docker's official GPG key by typing the following in a single line command:

    ``` bash
    curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
    ```

4. Add Docker's stable repository to Ubuntu packages list by typing the following in a single line command:

    ``` bash
    sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
    ```

5. Add NodeJs PPA to use NodeJS LTS release and update the Ubuntu packages and install Docker engine, node.js and the node package manager in a single step by typing the following in a single line command. When asked if you would like to proceed, respond by typing "Y" and pressing enter.

    ``` bash
    sudo apt-get install -y curl python-software-properties
    curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt install -y docker-ce nodejs mongodb-clients
    ```

6. Now, upgrade the Ubuntu packages to the latest version by typing the following in a single line command. When asked if you would like to proceed, respond by typing "Y" and pressing enter.

    ``` bash
    sudo apt-get upgrade -y
    ```

7. Install `docker-compose`

    ```bash
    sudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.21.2/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
    ```

8. When the command has completed, check the Docker version installed by executing this command. The output may look something like that shown in the following screen shot. Note that the server version is not shown yet, because you didn't run the command with elevated privileges (to be addressed shortly).

    ``` bash
    docker version
    ```

    ![In this screenshot of a Command Prompt window, docker version has been typed and run at the command prompt. Docker version information appears in the window.](media/b4-image28.png)

9. You may check the versions of node.js and npm as well, just for information purposes, using these commands:

    ``` bash
    nodejs --version

    npm -version
    ```

10. Install `bower`

    ```bash
    sudo npm install -g bower
    sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node
    ```

11. Add your user to the Docker group so that you do not have to elevate privileges with sudo for every command. You can ignore any errors you see in the output.

    ``` bash
    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
    ```

    ![In this screenshot of a Command Prompt window, sudo usermod -aG docker \$USER has been typed and run at the command prompt. Errors appear in the window.](media/b4-image29.png)

12. In order for the user permission changes to take effect, exit the SSH session by typing 'exit', then press \<Enter\>. Repeat the commands in Task 6: Connect securely to the build agent from step 4 to establish the SSH session again.

13. Run the Docker version command again, and note the output now shows the server version as well.

    ![In this screenshot of a Command Prompt window, docker version has been typed and run at the command prompt. Docker version information appears in the window, in addition to server version information.](media/b4-image30.png)

14. Run a few Docker commands:

    - One to see if there are any containers presently running.

        ``` bash
        docker container ls
        ```

    - One to see if any containers exist whether running or not.

        ``` bash
        docker container ls -a
        ```

15. In both cases, you will have an empty list but no errors running the command. Your build agent is ready with Docker engine running properly.

    ![In this screenshot of a Command Prompt window, docker container ls has been typed and run at the command prompt, as has the docker container ls -a command.](media/b4-image31.png)

### Task 9: Install Azure CLI

In later exercises, you will need the Azure CLI 2.0 to connect to your Kubernetes cluster and run commands from your local machine. A complete list of instructions for supported platforms is available on this page:

<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest>

1. For MacOS -- use homebrew:

    ``` bash
    brew update

    brew install azure-cli
    ```

2. For Windows -- using WSL _on your local machine (not the build agent)_:

    ``` bash
    AZ_REPO=$(lsb_release -cs)
    echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/azure-cli/ $AZ_REPO main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/azure-cli.list

    curl -L https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | sudo apt-key add -

    sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y azure-cli
    ```

### Task 10: Install Kubernetes CLI

In later exercises, you will need the Kubernetes CLI (kubectl) to deploy to your Kubernetes cluster and run commands from your local machine.

1. Install the Kubernetes client using Azure CLI:

    ``` bash
    az login

    sudo az aks install-cli --install-location /usr/local/bin/kubectl
    ```
    >**Note**: You may see this message but try kubectl version to confirm cli is working.

    ![In this screenshot of a Command Prompt window, installing kubectl.](media/b4-image61.png)

### Task 11: Install Helm

In later exercises, you will need the Helm client to deploy to your Kubernetes cluster and run commands from your local machine.

1. For MacOS -- use homebrew:

    ```bash
    brew update

    brew install kubernetes-helm
    ```

2. For Windows -- using WSL _on your local machine (not the build agent)_:

    ```bash
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/master/scripts/get > get_helm.sh
    chmod 700 get_helm.sh
    ./get_helm.sh
    ```

### Task 12: Download the FabMedical starter files

FabMedical has provided starter files for you. They have taken a copy of one of their websites, for their customer Contoso Neuro, and refactored it from a single node.js site into a website with a content API that serves up the speakers and sessions. This is a starting point to validate the containerization of their websites. They have asked you to use this to help them complete a POC that validates the development workflow for running the website and API as Docker containers and managing them within the Azure Kubernetes Service environment.

1. From WSL, download the starter files by typing the following curl instruction (case sensitive):

    ```bash
    curl -L -o FabMedical.tgz http://bit.ly/2uhZseT
    ```

    > **Important note**: If you'll be taking the Infrastructure edition of the lab, instead of using the above instructions, type the following ones:
    > 
    > ```bash
    > curl -L -o FabMedical.tgz https://bit.ly/2uDDZNq
    > ```
    > 
    > This will download the version of the starter files that will be used by that edition of the lab.

2. Create a new directory named FabMedical by typing in the following command:

    ```bash
    mkdir FabMedical
    ```

3. Unpack the archive with the following command. This command will extract the files from the archive to the FabMedical directory you created. The directory is case sensitive when you navigate to it.

    ```bash
    tar -C FabMedical -xzf FabMedical.tgz --strip-components=1
    ```

4. Navigate to FabMedical folder and list the contents.

    ```bash
    cd FabMedical

    # on Mac bash you may need to type `ls`
    ll
    ```

5. You'll see the listing includes three folders, one for the web site, another for the content API and one to initialize API data:

    ```bash
    content-api/
    content-init/
    content-web/
    ```

6. Next log into your Azure DevOps account.

    If this is your first time logging into this account you will be taken through a first-run experience:

    - Confirm your contact information and select next.
    - Select "Create new account".
    - Enter a fabmedical-SUFFIX for your account name and select Continue.

7. Create repositories to host the code.

    - Enter fabmedical as the project name.
    - Ensure the project is Private.
    - Click the Advanced dropdown.
    - Ensure the Version control is set to Git.
    - Click the "Create Project" button.

        ![Home page icon](media/b4-image51.png)

    - Once the project creation has completed, use the repository dropdown to create a new repository by selecting "+ New repository".

        ![Repository dropdown](media/b4-image53.png)

    - Enter "content-web" as the repository name.

    - Once the project is created click "Generate Git credentials".

        ![Generate Git Credentials](media/b4-image50.png)

        - Enter a password.
        - Confirm the password.
        - Select "Save Git Credentials".

    - Using your WSL window, set your username and email which are used in Azure DevOps for Git Commits.

        ```bash
        git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
        git config --global user.name "Your Name"
        ```

        For example:

        ```bash
        git config --global user.email "you@example.onmicrosoft.com"
        git config --global user.name "you@example.onmicrosoft.com"
        ```

    - Using your WSL window, configure git CLI to cache your credentials, so that you don't have to keep re-typing them.

        ```bash
        git config --global credential.helper cache
        ```

    - Using your WSL window, initialize a new git repository.

        ```bash
        cd content-web
        git init
        git add .
        git commit -m "Initial Commit"
        ```

    - Setup your Azure DevOps repository as a new remote for push. You can copy the commands for "**HTTPS**" to do this from your browser.  Edit the HTTPS URL as given below:

       Remove characters between "https://" and "dev.azure.com" from HTTPS URL of the copied commands.
       For example:

       ```bash
       From this https URL
       "git remote add origin https://fabmedical-sol@dev.azure.com/fabmedical-sol/fabmedical/_git/content-web
        git push -u origin --all"

       Remove "fabmedical-sol@" from the above url to make it like below:
       "git remote add origin https://dev.azure.com/fabmedical-sol/fabmedical/_git/content-web
        git push -u origin --all"
       ```

       Paste these commands into your WSL window.

       - When prompted, enter your Azure DevOps username and the git credentials password you created earlier in this task.

    - Use the repository dropdown to create a second repository called "content-api".

    - Using your WSL window, initialize a new git repository in the content-api directory.

        ```bash
        cd ../content-api
        git init
        git add .
        git commit -m "Initial Commit"
        ```

    - Setup your Azure DevOps repository as a new remote for push. Use the repository dropdown to switch to the "content-api" repository. You can then copy the commands for the setting up the content-api repository from your browser, then update the HTTPS URL as you did earlier for content-web repository HTTPS url. Paste these commands into your WSL window.

        - When prompted, enter your Azure DevOps username and the git credentials password you created earlier in this task.

    - Use the repository drop down to create a third repository called "content-init".

    - Using your WSL window, initialize a new git repository in the content-init directory.

        ```bash
        cd ../content-init
        git init
        git add .
        git commit -m "Initial Commit"
        ```

    - Setup your Azure DevOps repository as a new remote for push.  Use the repository drop down to switch to the "content-init" repository. You can then copy the commands for the setting up the content-init repository from your browser, then update the HTTPS URL as you did earlier for other repo's HTTPS url's. Paste these commands into your WSL window.

      - When prompted, enter your Azure DevOps username and the git credentials password you created earlier in this task.

8. Clone your repositories to the build agent.

    - From WSL, connect to the build agent VM as you did previously in Before the hands-on lab - Task 6: Connect securely to the build agent using the SSH command.

    - In your browser, switch to the "content-web" repository and click "Clone" in the right corner.

        ![This is a screenshot of the content-web repository page with the Clone button indicated.](media/b4-image55.png)

    - Copy the repository url.

    - Update the repository url by removing the characters between "https://" and "dev.azure.com".

      For example: modify the repository url "https://fabmedical-sol@dev.azure.com/fabmedical-sol/fabmedical/_git/content-web"
      as "https://dev.azure.com/fabmedical-sol/fabmedical/_git/content-web"

    - Use the repository url to clone the content-web code to your build agent machine.

        ```bash
        git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
        ```

    - In your browser, switch to the "content-api" repository and select "Clone" to see and copy the repository url and update the URL by removing some characters as you did earlier for content-web repository.

    - Use the repository url and `git clone` to copy the content-api code to your build agent.

    - In your browser, switch to the "content-init" repository and select "Clone" to see and copy the repository url and then update the url by removing some characters as you did earlier for other repositories.

    - Use the repository url and `git clone` to copy the content-init code to your build agent.

>**Note**: Keep this WSL window open as your build agent SSH connection. You will later open new WSL sessions to other machines.

You should follow all steps provided *before* performing the Hands-on lab.
